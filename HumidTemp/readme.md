  ## Match the Baud Rate in the Serial Monitor

- Open the Arduino IDE.
- After uploading your code, click the Serial Monitor icon (or press Ctrl + Shift + M).
- Set the baud rate in the Serial Monitor dropdown (bottom-right) to `115200`
- then you can see the temperature and humidity on the serial monitor
