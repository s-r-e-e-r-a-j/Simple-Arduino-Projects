## Motion Detection Light

The Motion Detection Light Project is an automated lighting system that uses a PIR sensor, Arduino Uno, relay module, and a 230V AC bulb to detect human motion and control the light accordingly. When motion is detected, the PIR sensor sends a signal to the Arduino, which then activates the relay module to turn the light ON. If no motion is detected, the light automatically turns OFF, ensuring energy efficiency, security, and convenience.

This project is ideal for home automation, security lighting, and energy-saving applications, making it a smart, cost-effective, and user-friendly solution for modern environments. 


## Components Required
